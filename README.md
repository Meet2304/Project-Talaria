<h1 align="center">Project Talaria</h1>

<p align = 'justify'>
  In the legends of Greek mythology, the god Hermes was gifted the Talaria—golden winged sandals that granted him the power of flight, swiftness, and the ability to journey between worlds. They symbolized speed, agility, and the divine gift of connection.
  <br>
  Project Talaria carries this spirit into the modern age. Just as Hermes used the Talaria to bridge the realms of gods and mortals, this innovation bridges the gap between human movement and deeper self-awareness. By embedding intelligence into footwear, Project Talaria transforms every step into insight—tracking motion, stride, and heart rhythm to empower individuals with knowledge about their health, vitality, and performance.
  <br>
  Project Talaria is more than technology; it is a call to elevate human potential. It embodies the timeless pursuit of strength, speed, and balance, inspiring us to not only move forward but to move with purpose. Through every stride, it reminds us that like Hermes, we too can transcend limits and walk closer to greatness.
