# Sharp Corners Update - January 2025

## Overview
Updated all cards and buttons across the application to have sharp corners instead of rounded ones, ensuring they blend perfectly with the emphasized corner decorators. Fixed corner decorator clipping issues.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Cards Still Rounded
**Problem**: Even after removing `rounded-xl` from FeatureCard, the underlying shadcn/ui Card component had `rounded-lg` built into its base styles.

**Solution**: Removed `rounded-lg` from the Card component base class in `src/components/ui/card.tsx`.

### Issue 2: Corner Decorators Clipped
**Problem**: The "Legend of Talaria" cards on both Home and About pages had `overflow-hidden` class, which was clipping the corner decorators that extend beyond the card boundaries (positioned at `-left-px`, `-right-px`, etc.).

**Solution**: Removed `overflow-hidden` from both mythology cards to allow corner decorators to display properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Card Component (`src/components/ui/card.tsx`) ⭐ **Critical Fix**
- **Removed**: `rounded-lg` from base Card className
- **Before**: `"rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm"`
- **After**: `"border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm"`
- **Impact**: All Card instances now have sharp corners by default

### 2. FeatureCard Component (`src/components/feature-card.tsx`)
- **Previously Fixed**: Removed `rounded-xl` from wrapper
- **Corner Decorators**: Positioned absolutely at `-1px` offsets to sit on card edges
- **Structure**:
  ```tsx
  <Card> {/* Now has sharp corners */}
    <CardDecorator /> {/* 4 corner border spans */}
    {children}
  </Card>
  ```

### 3. Button Component (`src/components/ui/button.tsx`)
- **Removed**: `rounded-md` from base button styles
- **Removed**: `rounded-md` from `sm` and `lg` size variants
- **Result**: All buttons now have sharp corners throughout the application

### 4. Home Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- **Legend of Talaria Card**: 
  - ✅ Removed `overflow-hidden` to prevent corner decorator clipping
  - ✅ Gradient background: `from-slate-50 via-blue-50 to-slate-100`
  - ✅ Proper section structure matching About page
- **Feature Cards**: 
  - ✅ Removed `rounded-lg` from all icon containers (4 cards)
  - ✅ Sharp corners now visible on all cards

### 5. About Page (`src/app/about/page.tsx`)
- **Mythology Card**: 
  - ✅ Removed `overflow-hidden` to prevent corner decorator clipping
  - ✅ Removed rounded corners from internal elements
- **Feature Cards**: 
  - ✅ Removed `rounded-lg` from all icon containers (4 cards)
  - ✅ All cards display sharp corners correctly

### 6. Internal Elements (Both Pages)
- Removed rounded corners from:
  - Icon background boxes (Heart, Activity, Footprints, TrendingUp icons)
  - Info boxes with border-left accent
  - Quote/callout boxes with dark backgrounds
- **Kept**: `rounded-full` on decorative line dividers (intentional design element)

## Technical Details

### Corner Decorator Implementation
```tsx
const CardDecorator = () => (
  <>
    {/* Top-left corner */}
    <span className="border-primary absolute -left-px -top-px block size-2 border-l-2 border-t-2"></span>
    
    {/* Top-right corner */}
    <span className="border-primary absolute -right-px -top-px block size-2 border-r-2 border-t-2"></span>
    
    {/* Bottom-left corner */}
    <span className="border-primary absolute -bottom-px -left-px block size-2 border-b-2 border-l-2"></span>
    
    {/* Bottom-right corner */}
    <span className="border-primary absolute -bottom-px -right-px block size-2 border-b-2 border-r-2"></span>
  </>
)
```

**Key Points**:
- Positioned at `-1px` to sit exactly on card edges
- `size-2` (8px × 8px) decorative corner boxes
- `border-2` (2px) border thickness
- Uses `border-primary` color for brand consistency
- **Requires parent NOT to have `overflow-hidden`**

## Visual Impact

### Before Fix:
```
┌─────────────┐  ← Rounded corners from Card component
│╭───────────╮│  ← Rounded corners from FeatureCard
││  Content  ││  ← Corner decorators hidden by overflow
│╰───────────╯│
└─────────────┘
```

### After Fix:
```
┌─────────────┐  ← Sharp corners from Card component
│┘  Content └ │  ← Corner decorators visible and aligned
│             │
│┐          ┌ │
└─────────────┘
```

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `src/components/ui/card.tsx` - **Removed `rounded-lg` from base Card**
2. ✅ `src/components/feature-card.tsx` - Removed `rounded-xl` (previous fix)
3. ✅ `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Removed rounded corners
4. ✅ `src/app/page.tsx` - Removed `overflow-hidden`, removed rounded internal elements
5. ✅ `src/app/about/page.tsx` - Removed `overflow-hidden`, removed rounded internal elements

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ All pages compile successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Dev server running without issues
- ✅ Visual consistency achieved across all pages
- ✅ Corner decorators fully visible (not clipped)
- ✅ Corner decorators align perfectly with card edges
- ✅ All cards have sharp 90-degree corners
- ✅ All buttons have sharp edges
- ✅ Internal elements have no unintended rounding

## Design Benefits
1. **Visual Cohesion**: Sharp corners match the angular corner decorators
2. **Modern Aesthetic**: Clean, geometric design language
3. **Brand Identity**: Emphasizes precision and technical sophistication
4. **Consistency**: Unified look across entire application
5. **Professional**: Corporate/premium feel matching the health tech domain
6. **Decorator Visibility**: Corner accents fully visible and impactful

## Common Pitfalls Avoided
1. ❌ **Don't use `overflow-hidden` on FeatureCard** - Clips corner decorators
2. ❌ **Don't add rounded corners to Card instances** - Conflicts with sharp design
3. ✅ **Keep decorators outside card boundaries** - Position at `-1px` offsets
4. ✅ **Remove all rounded classes systematically** - Check Card, FeatureCard, and internal elements

## Next Steps
Consider applying this sharp corner aesthetic to:
- Dashboard cards
- Team page elements  
- Modal dialogs
- Input fields (if desired for complete consistency)
- Any other Card component instances

## Browser Compatibility
- Sharp corners: ✅ All modern browsers
- Absolute positioning: ✅ All browsers
- Border styling: ✅ All browsers
- No special polyfills required
