# Model Integration Update - Local Hosting

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Model Files

---

## What Changed

### Problem
Firebase Storage requires a paid plan (Blaze tier), which you don't have access to.

### Solution
Updated the application to load TensorFlow.js models from the local `public/` folder instead of Firebase Storage. This is:
- ✅ **Free** - no cloud storage costs
- ✅ **Fast** - files served directly by Next.js
- ✅ **Simple** - just copy files to a folder
- ✅ **Offline-capable** - works after first load

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/ml-inference-interface.tsx`
**Changes:**
- ❌ Removed Firebase Storage imports (`ref`, `getDownloadURL`, `storage`)
- ✅ Updated `MODEL_PATH` from Firebase path to local: `"/models/Talaria-LSTM-v2/model.json"`
- ✅ Simplified `loadModel()` function to use direct path
- ✅ Updated error messages for local file troubleshooting

**Before:**
```typescript
import { ref, getDownloadURL } from "firebase/storage";
import { storage } from "@/lib/firebase";
const MODEL_PATH = "ml-models/Talaria-LSTM-v2";

const modelJsonRef = ref(storage, `${MODEL_PATH}/model.json`);
const modelJsonUrl = await getDownloadURL(modelJsonRef);
const model = await tf.loadLayersModel(modelJsonUrl);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const MODEL_PATH = "/models/Talaria-LSTM-v2/model.json";
const model = await tf.loadLayersModel(MODEL_PATH);
```

### 2. Directory Structure
**Created:**
```
Talaria/public/models/Talaria-LSTM-v2/
```

This folder is ready to receive your model files.

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful!**
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 18.8s
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (12/12)
```

**Predictions Page:**
- Size: 273 kB
- First Load: 462 kB
- Status: Static, optimized

Only console.log warnings (non-critical) remain - these are for debugging and don't affect functionality.

## Next Steps for You

### Step 1: Copy Model Files (Required)

**Source:** Your `tfjs_model_output` folder  
**Destination:** `Talaria\public\models\Talaria-LSTM-v2\`

**Files to copy:**
- `model.json` (required)
- All `.bin` files (weight files)

**Quick PowerShell Command:**
```powershell
Copy-Item "C:\Meet\Projects\Project_9_Talaria_Integrated Footwear System for Concurrent Cardiovascular and Gait Analysis\Project-Talaria\Machine Learning Model\tfjs_model_output\*" -Destination "C:\Meet\Projects\Project_9_Talaria_Integrated Footwear System for Concurrent Cardiovascular and Gait Analysis\Project-Talaria\Talaria\public\models\Talaria-LSTM-v2\" -Recurse
```

### Step 2: Restart Development Server

```powershell
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C), then:
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Model Loading

1. Navigate to Dashboard → Predictions
2. Click "Load Model" button
3. Check console for success message

### Step 4: Scaler Integration (After model loads)

Your model needs preprocessing with the scaler. Let me know:
1. Scaler type? (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)
2. Do you have the `.pkl` file or the parameters?

I'll help you:
- Export scaler to JSON format
- Add preprocessing function to the component
- Test full inference pipeline

## Technical Details

### Model Specifications
- **Type:** LSTM (TensorFlow.js)
- **Input Shape:** `[1, 50, 15]`
  - 1 batch
  - 50 time steps
  - 15 features (AccX, AccY, AccZ, GyroX, GyroY, GyroZ, Aroll, Apitch, Groll, Gpitch, Gy, Combroll, Combpitch, Heart Rate, SpO2)
- **Format:** TensorFlow.js (model.json + .bin weights)
- **Source:** Converted from Keras .h5

### File Serving
- **Next.js Public Folder:** Files in `public/` are served at root URL `/`
- **Model URL:** `http://localhost:3000/models/Talaria-LSTM-v2/model.json`
- **TensorFlow.js:** Automatically fetches weight files (.bin) referenced in model.json
- **Caching:** Browser caches model files after first load

### Dependencies
- **TensorFlow.js:** 4.22.0 (already installed)
- **React:** 19.0.0
- **Next.js:** 15.5.4

## Advantages of Local Hosting

| Aspect | Firebase Storage | Local Hosting |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Cost** | Paid (Blaze plan) | Free |
| **Setup** | Upload to cloud, configure rules | Copy files to folder |
| **Speed** | Network dependent | Direct server serving |
| **Offline** | Requires internet | Works after cache |
| **Version Control** | Separate from code | Can commit to git |
| **Deployment** | Same on all environments | Included in build |

## Questions?

**See:** `LOCAL_MODEL_SETUP.md` for comprehensive guide

**Common Issues:**
- Model not loading? Check files are in correct folder and server restarted
- CORS errors? Won't happen with local hosting
- Wrong predictions? Need to apply scaler preprocessing

---

**Ready to proceed!** Copy your model files and let me know when you're ready for the scaler integration.
